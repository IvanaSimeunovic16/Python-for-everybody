# Exercise 1: Rewrite your pay computation to give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours.
# Enter Hours: 45
# Enter Rate: 10
# Pay: 475.0

hours = float(input('Enter hours:'))

else:

print('Pay is: ', pay)


# Exercise 2: Rewrite your pay program using try and except so that your program handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message
# and exiting the program. The following shows two executions of the program
# Enter Hours: 20
# Enter Rate: nine
# Error, please enter numeric input

# Enter Hours: forty
# Error, please enter numeric input

    print('Pay is: ', pay)
except:
    print('Error, please enter numeric input!')
    
# Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is
# between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
# Score Grade
# >= 0.9 A
# >= 0.8 B
# >= 0.7 C
# >= 0.6 D
# < 0.6 F

score = float(input('Input your score: '))
